## WARNING
This project is in very early development. Please don't put any trust in it without vigorously vetting it yourself (if you *do* do that, let me know how it goes!)
Many things will be changing and you should consider the project unstable for the time being.

## Usage
Please see the help.txt file (for now). I'll have better documentation when the project matures :)

## Installation

* Change the working directory to where you want the file to be located

```zsh
cd /usr/local/bin
```

```zsh
sudo git clone https://github.com/B-Roux/ltcp-client.git
```
