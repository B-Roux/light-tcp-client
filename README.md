# ltcp-client
A (very) light-weight TCP client written in Python and operable from any terminal

## WARNING
This project is in very early development. Please don't put any trust in it without vigorously vetting it yourself (if you *do* do that, let me know how it goes!)
Many things will be changing and you should consider the project unstable for the time being.

## Usage
Please see the help.txt file (for now). I'll have better documentation when the project matures :)

## Installation
I need to add better installation, but for now you can just clone this repository and run it with
```$ Python3 [path/to/file/]tcp.py [your arguments]```
